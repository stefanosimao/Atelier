Initial Structure of the USIhoot

It will be a Single Page Application that will work with a database to store and organize 
the games, as well as using WebSockets for the real-time game sessions.

-Database to handle games:
    Each game is a set of questions and answers, organized as an array of objects.
    An object is made of a question and four answers, of which one is correct and three wrong.
    Each game as an _id to be differentiated by the others, and a name.

-Game creation:
    A form will be used to create each question with answers, and will be submitted
    only once the full set of questions is completed.
    It can expand to allow to add new questions. This can be handled with AJAX to add HTML
    to the page.

    
-Game lobby:
    A client can connect to a wating room until the host will start the game.
    A WebSocket can connect and count the number of players.
    The sets of questions will be available to the host to be picked and used for the session.

-Game session:
    All clients connected will be presented with the first question at the same time.
    The game will advance to the next question when all players answer, or when a timer runs out.
    A WebSocket will be used for the synchronization.
    Points will be awarded for the answers. A temporary storage will be used to keep track of each
    player's points.
    At the end, a podium will be computed and each client given a link to return to the main page.
