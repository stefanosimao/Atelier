Known Bugs:
-server response to POST "/game/joinGame" is not json, cannot render page within sendUsername() in ajax.js


Fixed:
-when adding an additional question in the quiz creation form, the previous fields are deleted.
-almost all the responses are 304 -> 304 means nothing changed from what you have in the cache
