## Optional Tasks

Please write here which optional tasks you have completed.

1. Navigation: Highlight the navigation entry corresponding to the currently active page.
2. Custom Fonts: Your site may optionally also load and use at least one custom font. Feel free to either use Web fonts, or to specify one using the @font-face CSS rule.
3. Form Placeholders: Before the user enters information the form fields are empty. Add some example text content which will disappear as soon as the user starts typing.
4. Favourite Star: Turn the favourite checkbox input into a star (or whatever shape you prefer) which changes color to indicate whether the checkbox input is checked or not. Use only HTML and CSS to implement this.
5. Interactive Table and Form: As the user moves the mouse over the table/form elements or enters information in the form, the style of the elements should smoothly change to highlight the current focus of attention.
